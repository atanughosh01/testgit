Q1: Why are you applying for Financial Aid?

Ans: I am a student of B.E (Graduation) in Computer Science & Engineering at Jadavpur University, Kolkata. I do not have any source of income to pay for this course. I belong to a lower-middle-class Indian family and since my parents are struggling to meet ends, and I am still a student, I cannot afford to pay for this course. Furthermore, I also do wish to enroll in the course "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng sir in near future through the financial aid program provided by Coursera. I am sure that I'll find it helpful for my career as a Data Scientist. Receiving this Financial Aid will open a new horizon of the world of Coursera courses for me. That, in turn, will help me achieve my future goals and build a successful career. I also plan to complete all the assignments on or before time to digest and apply the knowledge I'll learn from those respected professors. The Financial Aid will only push me further towards my goals and my dreams of one day having a successful career as a Data Scientist.


Q2: How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?

Ans: I am currently pursuing B.E (Graduation) in Computer Science & Engineering at Jadavpur University, Kolkata. I want to complete this course as I found this course helpful for my career and also that I can put a good CV/resume to get applied to a job. This course will boost my job prospects after graduation from University. It will kick-start me in Python Programming which is a must need in my career as a Data Scientist and will give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the knowledge and skills I'll receive from this course. Completing this course will boost my self-confidence, knowing that I not only completed a very important task but also took the responsibility of creating a foundation for getting me closer to my career goals. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely. I also plan to grade assignments, which are peer-reviewed, which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.


Q3: Would you consider using a low-interest loan to pay for your courses?

Ans: NO- I would not consider using a low-interest loan to pay for courses.


Q4: If you answered NO, please help us understand why.

Ans: As I have already mentioned above that I am presently a student pursuing my B.E (Graduation) in Computer Science & Engineering at Jadavpur University and don't have any source of income to pay for this course. My parents have a limited source of income and my present education is also on a bank loan. It is not even possible for me to pay the Coursera loan since my parents are finding it hard to meet ends. Taking this loan will become a huge burden on me and my family. It would be a great help if I get this course on the financial aid program. I will surely contribute to this platform which is helping me grow in my time of need.

Q1: Why are you applying for Financial Aid?

Ans: Hello, my name is Atanu Ghosh and I live in INDIA, a country in development. I'm applying for Financial Aid for this course because I do not have any special source of income and I don't earn enough money to afford the full tuition at this time of my life and career. Receiving Financial Aid for this course will help me get valuable knowledge in "Data Structure and Algorithms". I am searching for a job for a long time to earn money to take this course, and I did not find yet, the knowledge I will receive from this course will help me get a paid internship. I want to invest in my career and my education, but at this moment I can only invest my time to increase my skills to advance in my career and not the money. Hopefully, this will change in the upcoming years because I'm ambitious, I want to increase my programming knowledge and learn new tools and technologies for which this course will be extremely helpful. Looking forward to a positive response from the Coursera team.


Q2: How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?

Ans: I want to take this course as I want to learn Data Structures and Algorithms. I want to complete the course due to my curiosity and also that I can put a good CV to a get applied to a job. This course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help me perform better in carrying out various programs in a computer language and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the knowledge I'd get from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments that are peer-reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.


Q3: Would you consider using a low-interest loan to pay for your courses?

Ans: NO- I would not consider using a low-interest loan to pay for courses.


Q4: If you answered NO, please help us understand why.

Ans: Sir, the financial status of the family is not that good to pay the loan amount. We already have a lot of debt in the bank and my parents are paying it on regular basis. It would make their life even harder to add a new loan over them. I don't want to put any pressure on them. Sir, it would be a great help for me to get a good job and help my family if I get selected for this course.

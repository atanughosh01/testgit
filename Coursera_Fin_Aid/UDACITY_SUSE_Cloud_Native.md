Q: What do you hope to accomplish through this program? 
[*Please comment on relevant personal and professional goals. Include information about professional achievements (e.g., projects) that demonstrate how you have worked towards your goal. Please answer using complete sentences and no more than 150 words.]

Ans: In the short term, I plan to build responsive and powerful web apps. I have already begun building my skills in web development. I am proficient with Python, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Git, and GitHub, and am starting to learn React.js and build websites.
In the long term, I will use the skills I build with Udacity to make a positive impact on society. After building skills in this program, I will be able to deliver improved web services to make the user's experience smooth, more efficient, reproducible, and sustainable. Web development engages the two major motivating outcomes in my life, focused personal growth and positive impact.
I am most happy when I am improving myself. Web developers use a large set of tools and skills. I have enjoyed building these skills so far. My vision for improving the user's experience leads my personal growth to be focused and purposeful.


Q: Why should you receive a scholarship? 
[*Please include a detailed response between 100-250 words.]

Ans: As I have already mentioned above that I am presently a student pursuing my B.E (Graduation) in Computer Science & Engineering at Jadavpur University and don't have any source of income to pay for this course. My parents have a limited source of income and my present education is also on a bank loan. It is not possible for me to pay for another loan (which I had to take if this scholarship program didn't exist) since my parents are finding it hard to meet ends. Taking this loan will become a huge burden on me and my family. It would be a great help if I get this course on the Udacity scholarship program. I will surely contribute to this platform, which is helping me grow in my time of need.

Q1: Why are you applying for Financial Aid?

Ans: I am a student of B.E (Graduation) in Computer Science & Engineering at Jadavpur University, Kolkata. I do not have any source of income to pay for this course. I belong to a lower-middle-class Indian family and since my parents are struggling to meet ends, and I am still a student, I cannot afford to pay for this course. I am sure that I'll find it helpful for my career as a Software Programmer. Receiving this Financial Aid will open a new horizon of the world of Coursera courses for me. That, in turn, will help me achieve my future goals and build a successful career. I also plan to complete all the assignments on or before time to digest and apply the knowledge I'll learn from those respected professors. The Financial Aid will only push me further towards my goals and my dreams of one day having a successful career as a Software Developer.


Q2: How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?

Ans: I want to take this course as I want to learn C++ and Data Algorithms. I want to complete the course due to my curiosity and also that I can put a good CV to a get applied to a job. This course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help me perform better in carrying out various programs in a computer language and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the knowledge I'd get from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments that are peer-reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.


Q3: Would you consider using a low-interest loan to pay for your courses?

Ans: NO- I would not consider using a low-interest loan to pay for courses.


Q4: If you answered NO, please help us understand why.

Ans: As I have already mentioned above that I am presently a student pursuing my B.E (Graduation) in Computer Science & Engineering at Jadavpur University and don't have any source of income to pay for this course. My parents have a limited source of income and my present education is also on a bank loan. It is not even possible for me to pay the Coursera loan since my parents are finding it hard to meet ends. Taking this loan will become a huge burden on me and my family. It would be a great help if I get this course on the financial aid program. I will surely contribute to this platform which is helping me grow in my time of need.

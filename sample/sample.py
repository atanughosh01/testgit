""" 9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who
has sent the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From '
lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail.
The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to
a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is
produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find
the most prolific committer. """
